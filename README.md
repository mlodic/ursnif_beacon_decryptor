# Ursnif beacon decryptor

Ursnif v.3 aka Dreambot/Gozi/ISFB

This is a simple script that could be used to:
* check if a suspicious URL is correlated to Ursnif activity
* decrypt the URL check-in on the fly to get the data sent to the C2 server

#### Usage:
```
python3 ursnif_beacon_decryptor.py -u <url> -k <key>

```

#### Example:
Input:
```
python3 ursnif_beacon_decryptor.py -u "http://qjdyugisselle.club/images/NM_2Ff8mqmMQjmr/c842xf8TIJp_2FlmC5/Ulz244kFh/KMjQpHVvOnBhk6eOvBBW/R_2FCf2Bk9wZXqeGcBS/IAHu5OfIJa7Y941YuvL1XM/i2RXCwmaVXV_2/ByGxravm/Dt1GoxZJ9b2BbnKWLrfphW9/8pKXBhb9Yi/n0AEln6Sc_2BilzFW/k_2B_2Fy1/Q3.avi" -k "10291029JSJUYNHG"
```
Output:
```
[2019-04-15 11:24:25 - INFO] c2 domain: 'qjdyugisselle.club'
[2019-04-15 11:24:25 - INFO] path to analyze: /images/NM_2Ff8mqmMQjmr/c842xf8TIJp_2FlmC5/Ulz244kFh/KMjQpHVvOnBhk6eOvBBW/R_2FCf2Bk9wZXqeGcBS/IAHu5OfIJa7Y941YuvL1XM/i2RXCwmaVXV_2/ByGxravm/Dt1GoxZJ9b2BbnKWLrfphW9/8pKXBhb9Yi/n0AEln6Sc_2BilzFW/k_2B_2Fy1/Q3.avi
[2019-04-15 11:24:25 - INFO] Congrats! decoded data: fjidtflrb=bdaxhhfg&soft=3&version=217173&user=a618b5f78c4ff30be60d08c7ba561278&server=12&id=3274&crc=3&uptime=11
```

Params:
* fjidtflrb -> junk param, always present at the start of the uri to generate randomness (and always different)
* soft -> major version
* version -> minor version
* user -> unique user id
* server -> unique c2 server id
* id -> bot group id
* crc -> payload to retrieve (1-DLL32b, 2-DLL64b, 3-ps1)
* uptime -> time elapsed from initial infection (seconds)


#### Requirements
* Python3

If you run a Linux environment, you can just run the python script that will load `Driver.so` that is needed to perform decryption.

If you run a Windows OS, you should re-compile `Driver.cpp` and change the library loaded with the new one.

#### Additional info
The script needs the key that the malware uses for encryption.

Some reverse engineering is required to get that info.

However, observations led to the fact that the key is usually shared among a lot of samples and rarely changed.

If you don't have one, you could just run the script that would try our predefined keys that we saw the malware used in the wild
